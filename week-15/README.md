# Week 15 - Capturing Manuscripts

How do we digitize? Usually this means making an image, but what are the best \(and safest\) ways to get an image of a medieval manuscript \(or any document, frankly\). [This week's readings](https://medievalbook.gitbook.io/digitizing-medieval-archives/readings#15-capturing-medieval-manuscripts) try to give us a sense of how to image documents. 

The best way to get a feel for this is to actually try to do it. So we might be spending part of the class in the Department of History's DH lab \(don't get too excited, it just has some computers and a photo rig\). But we will be also visiting the Gatineau Preservation Centre to see their Digitization lab, so we'll also get a sense of what they are doing.
