# Digital Latin Library

Unlike the _Fragmentarium_ project, the Digital Latin Library is more concerned with presenting editions than describing manuscripts. Their template thus focuses less on physical description of manuscripts, and more on the editorial _apparati_ necessary for a modern digital critical edition, which is more closely aligned with the guide to TEI produced by [Andrew Dunning](https://andrewdunning.ca/transcribing-medieval-manuscripts-tei). 

The TEI header material is roughly similar between the DLL and the _Fragmentarium_ project_,_ but afterwards differs considerably. This divergence demonstrates the adaptability of the TEI coding guidelines. While our previous example was mostly &lt;fileDesc&gt; information, this template is mostly a &lt;text&gt; block:

 <!--
This is a subsection within the preface. Editors should use
            subsections (with <div>) to organize the content of the edition's
            preface. For example, there might be a subsection devoted to
            the description of manuscripts.

<back>
 <!--
The content of the back matter will be determined in consultation between
        the editor and the staff of the DLL. Because LDLT editions are encoded, the
        matter traditionally found in the back of a printed critical edition may be
        generated by applications instead of having to be entered manually.
        Nevertheless, there is space here for notes, indices, and other kinds of
        information.
