# Week 19 - TEI



In this class we will be looking at the guidelines for encoding medieval manuscripts developed by the TEI \(Text Encoding Initiative\). Shawn Hawkins \(College of the Humanities\) will be coming to talk to us about his ongoing collaboration to develop a digital edition of a fifteenth-century commentary on the Roman poet Catullus.

* Andrew Dunning \(UofToronto\) has put together a brief post about how to author digital critical editions, including LaTex, Classical Text Editor and TEI. 
* To work with TEI, [h](https://andrewdunning.ca/getting-started-editing-tei-xml-atom)e also has written out a useful starting guide, including who to install Atom on your computer \(which you have already\). 
* For a sense of what TEI is about take a look at Lou Burnard's short Open Edition [_What is the Text Encoding Initiative: How to add intelligent markup to digital resources_ ](https://books.openedition.org/oep/426?format=toc)_._ All in, this text runs to 114 pages, so read from the "Introduction" until the end of "Varieties of textual structure". Please read the whole thing if you get intrigued.
*  For a medieval specific TEI guidelines, please take a look at the Digital Latin Library's [Guidelines Webpage](https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html) or as a repository on [Github](https://github.com/DigitalLatin/guidelines).
* In class and for homework, you will begin your first TEI edition by following this [DLL training session](https://github.com/DigitalLatin/training).
