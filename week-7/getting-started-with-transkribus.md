# Transcribing with Transkribus



Take a look at the panel on the left-hand side and click **Login**. Use your Transkribus credentials \(Email address and password\).

{% hint style="info" %}
Note:  
Prior to this step you must give your username \(the email you signed up with\) to [Marc](../about.md#contact-us) so that you can be added to the collection. Otherwise when you login there will be no documents to view.
{% endhint %}

You should now be logged in. To access this course's collection, click on **Collections** and select the collection named "Ottawa, ARC, Carleton University, Medieval Folios". What will appear is a list of the folios uploaded to this collection.

Double-click on your folio to open it. Depending on your computer and the size of the scan, this could take a few seconds.

Once your document is ready, navigate to the **Tools** tab.   
With Current Transcript, Find Text Regions, and Find Lines in Text Regions selected, hit **Run**.   
  
This process will take a few moments. When eventually prompted, **refresh the image** and you will see that Transkribus has generated a text space or text spaces \(green\) for you. Within this text space are also lines \(blue\).   
  
You may begin transcribing now by selecting a line.
