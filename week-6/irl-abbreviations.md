# IRL Abbreviations

In preparing for the class in week 7, I want you to think about the method behind the madness of modern abbreviations. We'll be making a list of commonly used abbreviations \(that you all use today\) on the [Github wiki](https://github.com/MedievalBook/HIST4006/wiki/Abbreviations). Navigate there and add your own commonly used shortforms...

Then install some medieval inspired unicode fonts, which will allow you to put together a document as if you were a medieval scribe using typical abbreviations. Instructions for installation follow. We'll be using the fonts/ their voluminous codebooks in class for week 7.
