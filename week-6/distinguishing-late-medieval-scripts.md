# Distinguishing Late Medieval Scripts

At Carleton we have a number of late medieval folios and manuscripts - all dating from the thirteenth-century to the sixteenth century. You goal is to apply the following criteria to discern the characteristics of the script of your folio so that you can begin to understand its time and place of origin.

## Checklist for identifying late medieval scripts

Instead of putting together something here, I will point you to the excellent work done elsewhere online:

* revamped virtual palaeography school, the [_vHMML_](https://www.vhmmlschool.org/) __which provides an introduction to the Latin, Greek and Arabic traditions
* a series of transcription exercises are available on an Interactive Album of Mediaeval Palaeography. This [site](http://paleographie.huma-num.fr/index.php?l=en) allows students to read and examine examples of scripts from the seventh to the seventeenth century. The site was originally developed in French, but now \(for the most part\) available in English. 
* And this French language [dossier](http://theleme.enc.sorbonne.fr/dossiers/index.php) \(album of palaeographical examples\) used for teaching students at the _Ã‰cole des chartes_ is very useful in that it provides images, transcriptions, translations and then a palaeographical commentary \(albeit all in French\).
