# Week 13 - The Theory of the Digital

What is the difference between a manuscript and a digital version of it? This class welcomes students back from break and begins our focus on digitization in earnest. Our first question should be, what makes a digital project, digital? When we turn a manuscript into 1's and 0's, what do we do to it? What do we gain, or lose? 

This class is just debate, discussion and brainstorming. No practical exercises.
