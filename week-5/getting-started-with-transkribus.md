# Getting prepared for Transkribus

We won't be using [Transkribus](https://transkribus.eu) this week, but you need to register for an account in advance and the approval process can vary \(late time I checked they were still manually approving registrations\). Before you can download the software you need to register at [https://transkribus.eu](https://transkribus.eu). On the top right corner of the webpage, click on "Register" and fill in the information. Now wait for the email that says you've been registered.

...

You've waited for so long but now you've got the email! First, let your professor know on Slack what email and username you used, so that he can add you to our group. Actually, you might want to wait a bit longer for you to be added before you bother to install the software.

You've waited some more. The professor has let you know you've been added. And now! Transkribus can be yours! All yours! Go back to [https://transkribus.eu](https://transkribus.eu) and download the software after entering your user name and password. Once you've installed it, you will be confronted by a piece of software that is baffling complex and could only have been designed by a bunch of German academics with a disregard for any sort of User Experience design expertise. But don't worry â€“we'll take you through it. Look below for help on installing **Transkribus**.

Click on the LOGIN button in the top left corner and put in your username and password. If you've gotten the go ahead from the professor, you should sign in and see "Ottawa, ARC, Carleton University, medieval folios" under the heading collections. In the box below this, you should see a number of "Scans". If you are using an ARC folio, try to locate yours. If you are using a CUAG folio, click on the button that says \(Ottawa, ARC ...\) and you will be brought to a box which allows you to shift to the CUAG folios. Try switching between them. 

And that's it. You don't need to do anything more.

### Downloading and Installing Transkribus

To get started you will need to sign up for an account on the [Transkribus website](https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/). Once you have your account set up, sign in and download the app for free. From here on out follow the instructions below for **your operating system**.

**I'm running a MacOs**

1. Head to the folder where Transkribus.zip was downloaded to and unzip it into a folder of your choice \(a good option is always your project/course folder\). Transkribus might have been unzipped for you. In that case, simply move the folder to your project folder.
2. Open the Transkribus folder and double click on the executable file \(Transkribus.command\).

**I'm running Windows**

5. Head to the folder where Transkribus.zip was downloaded to and unzip it into a folder of your choice \(a good option would be to add it to your project or class folder\).
