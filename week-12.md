# Week 12 - Whetting your Digital Appetite

We're going to try to speak by Skype with Tuija Ainonen, curator at the British Library on the newly launched digital collaboration [_Medieval England and France, 700-1200_](https://www.bl.uk/medieval-english-french-manuscripts/themes) __between the British Library \(London\) and the Bibblioth√®que Nationale de France \(Paris\). Tuija Ainonen is a graduate of the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto, codicologist and now curator at the British Library. Be prepared to ask questions about the project but also how Dr. Ainonen came to be involved in the project.
