### More about me
Here is a link to [my Hcommons profile](https://hcommons.org/members/katebrasseur/)

Here are four emoticons that represent me:

1. :european_castle:
2. :cat2:
3. :cherry_blossom:
4. :rainbow:
```

And then **File** &gt;&gt; **Save As..**. and name the file like this:

```text
last name.first name.profile.md

**Step 3:** Navigate to the **Packages** tab and select **Markdown Preview** &gt;&gt; **Toggle Preview** to see a live preview of your Markdown in action.
