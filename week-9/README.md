# Week 9 - Liturgical Genres

This week we will be trying to understand the genre of the things we are working with. They are for the most part liturgical books, so we will be trying to understand what the liturgy is, what it is for and how to work on it.   


We will be visited by our colleague in the Music department and specialist of early Music, Alexis Luko. She will lead us through a basic introduction of how to transcribe medieval music and how to turn the instructions given on the page into something comprehensible as "stage directions" for liturgical performance.
