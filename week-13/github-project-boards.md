# Github Project Boards

[Our Github project page ](https://github.com/MedievalBook/HIST4006/projects/1)is largely empty at this point. The goal is that it becomes a way for everyone to work together on a final project. Check it out before doing anything else. Yup. Not very exciting. 

1. Making sure you are signed into Github, check to see whether you can edit the project board. 
2. If yes, great! Post on the Slack \#github channel that you can edit the project board. 
3. If no, post that you can't on the Slack \#github channel. I'll try to make sure everyone can edit. 
4. Read [this introduction](https://github.community/t5/Support-Protips/Using-project-boards-for-task-management/ba-p/8437) to the Github Project board.
5. Play with a bit. 
6. Decide whether to use this or stick with Slack to project manage tasks.
