# Welcome to HIST 4006A

This resource is intended to guide students through the exercises for learning about digitizing medieval manuscripts. Over the course of the year, we will be learning terminology, how to use different kinds of digital tools as well as picking up a basic sense of how to think about/ describe medieval material. 

The sidebar organizes material week by week so this guide should act as a kind of calendar for exercises to be done after/ for class.
