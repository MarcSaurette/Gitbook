# Week 18 - Online Exhibits

This week we will be thinking about online presentations of medieval manuscripts. We have looked at a number of examples already this year, but we will take a look at two online presentations of images/ texts and compare their strengths/ weaknesses.

Much of the class time will also be spent catching each other up on the work we have been doing on the group project, and brainstorming how to move forward.
