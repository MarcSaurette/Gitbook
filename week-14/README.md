# Week 14 - The Promise of DH

This week we will explore the current state of DH endeavours. By looking at a number of recent DH projects, we seek to understand what scholars are working on today and why. Pay attention to the core goals of the projects, the members of the team, and try to understand the stages necessary to its production \(this last task will be easier for some projects than others which use tools we are not familiar with\). The purpose of looking at a number of case studies is to determine answers to \(among others\) what is DH best suited to tackle? What is feasible for us to tackle in class? What steps do we need to take as we develop a collective project?
