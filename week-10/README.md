# Week 10 - Cataloguing

Our goal this week is to understand the purpose and the nature of manuscript catalogues. These have traditionally been printed, but \(since they are essentially just structured data tables\) they have increasingly moved online as searchable databases, such as our Omeka site \(remember that?\). In class, we will explore what a good catalogue is intended to do \(cf. Shailor's introduction\) and how they work \(what are common abbreviations, organizations etc.\).
