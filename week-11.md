# Week 11 - Workday

This week you all are working hard to catalogue your folios. The manuscripts will be out and everyone can work independently. Unless you need some time with me - then [choose a time](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14oSGKS_gNJ7uYbqBN2tGQWXJZVYkq9BozylFISGrgrc/edit?usp=sharing) to work with me.
