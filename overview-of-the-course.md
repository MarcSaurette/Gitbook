Classwork/ Homework: Export transcription from Trankribus and convert Omeka folio description/ transcription into TEI format. Afterwards, combine them all into a single digital edition of the HIST4006 Folios.

#### Week 20. How to ensure longevity/ accessibility

One problem with digital projects is longevity. Are we to imagine these as ephemera – meant to be fleeting instantiations of academic work – or do we treat them as permanent contributions. If the latter, how do we ensure that projects remain not just consultable, but also accessible to a diverse range of readers? We still use printed books from 4 centuries ago. Can we imagine the same will be said of digital editions? How do we make it so?

A Librarian from MacOdrum Library will come talk about how libraries seek to ensure the viability of electronic resources. 

#### Week 21 and 22. Free work/ Meeting with Professor

During class time for these two weeks, students will meet with the professor one-on-one to get help with their final project.

#### Weeks 23 and 24. Student Presentations.

During class time for these two weeks, students will meet make formal 15 minute presentations of their work to the class.

#### Week 25.

Final debrief - class display of final digital exhibitions; hopes and dream for the future.
